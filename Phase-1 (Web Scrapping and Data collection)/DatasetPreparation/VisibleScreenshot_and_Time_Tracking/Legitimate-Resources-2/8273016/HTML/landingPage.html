  "articleBody" : "Wie viele andere Online-Plattformen hat auch Twitter den freiwilligen EU-Verhaltenskodex gegen Desinformation unterzeichnet, will ihn nun wohl aber nicht mehr erfüllen. EU-Kommissar Breton sagt, Twitter könne sich vor Vorschriften nicht verstecken.  Twitter tritt nach Angaben aus der EU-Kommission aus einem EU-Abkommen zur Bekämpfung von Desinformation im Internet aus. EU-Binnenmarktkommissar Thierry Breton twitterte, die Social-Media-Plattform kehre dem freiwilligen Verhaltenskodex den Rücken zu. \"Aber Verpflichtungen bleiben. Sie können weglaufen, aber sie können sich nicht verstecken\", schrieb er.  Über die freiwilligen Selbstverpflichtungen hinaus werde der Kampf gegen Desinformation im Rahmen des EU-Gesetzes über Digitale Dienste (DSA) vom 25. August an verpflichtend sein. \"Unsere Teams werden zur Durchsetzung bereit sein.\"  Social-Media-Beitrag auf Twitter von Thierry Breton: &quot;Twitter leaves EU voluntary Code of Practice against disinformation.But obligations remain. You can run but you can’t hide. Beyond voluntary commitments, fighting disinformation will be legal obligation under #DSA as of August 25.Our teams will be ready for enforcement.&quot; Faeser: Werden Recht durchsetzen Bundesinnenministerin Nancy Faeser nannte das Vorgehen von Twitter verantwortungslos. \"Desinformation, Lügen und Propaganda befeuern Hass und sind Gift für die Demokratie\", schrieb die SPD-Politikerin auf Twitter. \"Unser Recht gilt für alle Plattformen, wir werden es durchsetzen.\"  Social-Media-Beitrag auf Twitter von Nancy Faeser: &quot;Desinformation, Lügen und Propaganda befeuern Hass und sind Gift für die Demokratie. Twitter trägt Verantwortung. Dieser Schritt ist verantwortungslos. Aber unser Recht gilt für alle Plattformen, wir werden es durchsetzen. Gut, dass es in Kürze striktere EU-Regeln gibt. https://t.co/ya0RLZbTqq&quot; Twitter-Bericht blieb hinter anderen zurück Der freiwillige EU-Verhaltenskodex verlangt von den Unternehmen, gegen die Verbreitung von Falschinformationen vorzugehen und regelmäßig Bericht über die Fortschritte zu erstatten. Dabei geht es unter anderem darum, wie viele Fake-Accounts erstellt und genutzt wurden oder wie sich Faktenchecks auf die Verbreitung von Desinformationen auswirkten. Zu den Unternehmen, die den Kodex unterzeichnet haben, gehören neben Twitter etwa Google, Tiktok, Microsoft sowie der Mutterkonzern von Facebook und Instagram, Meta.  Anzeichen, dass Twitter nicht bereit ist, den selbstauferlegten Verpflichtungen nachzukommen, gab es bereits. Im Februar hatte die EU-Kommission Berichte darüber veröffentlicht wie die Online-Plattformen die Regeln umsetzen. Der Bericht von Twitter sei hinter den anderen zurückgeblieben, stellte die Brüsseler Behörde damals fest. Was eingereicht worden sei, habe nur wenig spezifische Informationen und keine zielgerichteten Daten enthalten, hieß es.  Das Gesetz über Digitale Dienste (Digital Service Act, DSA) soll darüber hinaus unter anderem sicherstellen, dass Plattformen illegale Inhalte auf ihren Seiten schneller entfernen. Die Vorgaben gelten ab Mitte Februar 2024 in der gesamten EU - für besonders große Plattformen schon früher. Bei Verstößen drohen Bußgelder von bis zu sechs Prozent des Jahresumsatzes.  Keine Stellungnahme von Twitter Das von Tech-Milliardär Elon Musk übernommene Unternehmen mit Sitz in San Francisco reagierte auf Presseanfragen zu dem Vorgang mit einer automatisierten Antwort - wie in den meisten Fällen. Stellung bezog Twitter nicht.  Seit der Übernahme hat Musk frühere Regeln gegen Desinformation abgeschafft, das plattformeigene Verifikationssystem für Nutzerkonten verworfen und durch ein Abomodell ersetzt. Sein erklärtes Ziel ist es, Twitter zu einem \"digitalen Marktplatz\" zu machen.   Den Chefposten will Musk demächst abgeben. Ihm folgt die Werbe-Expertin Linda Yaccarino, die ihren Posten etwa Ende Juni antreten soll. ",

         Wie viele andere Online-Plattformen hat auch Twitter den freiwilligen EU-Verhaltenskodex gegen Desinformation unterzeichnet, will ihn nun wohl aber nicht mehr erfüllen. EU-Kommissar Breton sagt, Twitter könne sich vor Vorschriften nicht verstecken.

        Twitter tritt nach Angaben aus der EU-Kommission aus einem EU-Abkommen zur Bekämpfung von Desinformation im Internet aus. EU-Binnenmarktkommissar Thierry Breton twitterte, die Social-Media-Plattform kehre dem freiwilligen Verhaltenskodex den Rücken zu. "Aber Verpflichtungen bleiben. Sie können weglaufen, aber sie können sich nicht verstecken", schrieb er.
       </p>
       <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
        Über die freiwilligen Selbstverpflichtungen hinaus werde der Kampf gegen Desinformation im Rahmen des EU-Gesetzes über Digitale Dienste (DSA) vom 25. August an verpflichtend sein. "Unsere Teams werden zur Durchsetzung bereit sein."

        Bundesinnenministerin Nancy Faeser nannte das Vorgehen von Twitter verantwortungslos. "Desinformation, Lügen und Propaganda befeuern Hass und sind Gift für die Demokratie", schrieb die SPD-Politikerin auf Twitter. "Unser Recht gilt für alle Plattformen, wir werden es durchsetzen."

        Twitter-Bericht blieb hinter anderen zurück
       </h2>
       <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
        Der freiwillige EU-Verhaltenskodex verlangt von den Unternehmen, gegen die Verbreitung von Falschinformationen vorzugehen und regelmäßig Bericht über die Fortschritte zu erstatten. Dabei geht es unter anderem darum, wie viele Fake-Accounts erstellt und genutzt wurden oder wie sich Faktenchecks auf die Verbreitung von Desinformationen auswirkten. Zu den Unternehmen, die den Kodex unterzeichnet haben, gehören neben Twitter etwa Google, Tiktok, Microsoft sowie der Mutterkonzern von Facebook und Instagram, Meta.
       </p>
       <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
        Anzeichen, dass Twitter nicht bereit ist, den selbstauferlegten Verpflichtungen nachzukommen, gab es bereits. Im Februar hatte die EU-Kommission Berichte darüber veröffentlicht wie die Online-Plattformen die Regeln umsetzen. Der Bericht von Twitter sei hinter den anderen zurückgeblieben, stellte die Brüsseler Behörde damals fest. Was eingereicht worden sei, habe nur wenig spezifische Informationen und keine zielgerichteten Daten enthalten, hieß es.
       </p>
       <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
        Das Gesetz über Digitale Dienste (Digital Service Act, DSA) soll darüber hinaus unter anderem sicherstellen, dass Plattformen illegale Inhalte auf ihren Seiten schneller entfernen. Die Vorgaben gelten ab Mitte Februar 2024 in der gesamten EU - für besonders große Plattformen schon früher. Bei Verstößen drohen Bußgelder von bis zu sechs Prozent des Jahresumsatzes.

        Keine Stellungnahme von Twitter
       </h2>
       <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
        Das von Tech-Milliardär Elon Musk übernommene Unternehmen mit Sitz in San Francisco reagierte auf Presseanfragen zu dem Vorgang mit einer automatisierten Antwort - wie in den meisten Fällen. Stellung bezog Twitter nicht.
       </p>
       <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
        Seit der Übernahme hat Musk frühere Regeln gegen Desinformation abgeschafft, das plattformeigene Verifikationssystem für Nutzerkonten verworfen und durch ein Abomodell ersetzt. Sein erklärtes Ziel ist es, Twitter zu einem "digitalen Marktplatz" zu machen.
