at urlscan.io!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to take the opportunity to revisit major changes that launched in
2022 and to give you a glimpse of our 2023 roadmap at the same time. Some of
the things we have worked on in 2022 represent the foundation for new products
due to launch over the next quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;may-2022-visual-search&quot;&gt;May 2022: Visual Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May of 2022 we announced the cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/05/02/visual-search/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual
Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; feature within urlscan Pro. By
itself, this feature allows customers to hunt for scans of websites using only
the visual appearance of their screenshot. urlscan itself uses the visual
similarity of a website to improve our brand and phishing detection. The fact
that we are able to offer this feature at our scale and with a meaningful
accuracy means that we and our customers are now able to detect and attribute
phishing pages using &lt;em&gt;Visual Similarity&lt;/em&gt; instead of only relying on threshold
or rule-based approaches which work on text or HTTP content of websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;july-2022-saved-searches--subscriptions&quot;&gt;July 2022: Saved Searches &amp;amp; Subscriptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July we launched a frequently-requested feature in the form
of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/07/11/urlscan-pro-product-updates-for-q2-2022/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saved Searches &amp;amp; Email
Subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This feature lets customers &lt;em&gt;bookmark&lt;/em&gt; interesting hunt searches from within the
urlscan Pro UI. Furthermore, customers are now able to &lt;em&gt;subscribe&lt;/em&gt; to email
alerts whenever there are new hits for their searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;november-2022-newly-observed-hostnames--domains&quot;&gt;November 2022: Newly Observed Hostnames &amp;amp; Domains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November of last year we launched the real-time &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/11/22/newly-observed-domains-and-hostnames/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newly Observed Hostnames
&amp;amp; Domains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; datasource
in urlscan Pro. As we said back then, this new feed of data means a great deal
for both urlscan and our customers as it will enable multiple use-cases going
forward. Previously we had to rely on someone submitting a URL to urlscan.io in
order for us to know about the URL and its hostname. Now, we ingest millions of
hostnames and domains every day from a variety of sources, and we can observe
hostnames long before they are starting to host website content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to the data is available through urlscan Pro, and our customers are
already using it to identify potentially malicious domains and hostnames (e.g.
typosquatting) but also to look at their own infrastructure, for example via
subdomain enumeration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;launching-in-2023-urlscan-observe&quot;&gt;Launching in 2023: urlscan &lt;em&gt;Observe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next year, the big theme for us will be combining the building blocks
we already have into a more powerful and more convenient hands-off pipeline. A
big recurring ask from our customers is a set-and-forget system that lets them
enter keywords and search expressions and hand off the responsibility for
monitoring any hits to urlscan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why, starting in Q2 of 2023, we will be offering a new module called
&lt;em&gt;urlscan Observe&lt;/em&gt;. urlscan Observe will be our hands-off monitoring system for new
domains, hostnames, and URLs. It will perform the onerous job of watching for
&lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; to interesting &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; (like domains and URLs) over &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;. The end
result for customers is a concise timeline of changes to the &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; being
monitored along with frequent alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nut-shell, urlscan &lt;em&gt;Observe&lt;/em&gt; will support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customer-supplied keywords and search patterns to match against the newly observed domains &amp;amp; hostnames feed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending customers alerts about new hits for these keywords&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically monitoring for changes related to these hits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alerting customers about infrastructure changes to these hits: DNS records, new subdomains, active HTTP servers, website content, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Letting customers manually specify domains and URLs to watch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-subscription-options&quot;&gt;New Subscription Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2023 we have also overhauled &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/pricing/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our plans &amp;amp;
pricing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Going forward we have one subscription
aimed at customers that are only looking for an automation capability, and we
have three subscription levels for customers that also want to leverage our
powerful urlscan Pro - Threat Hunting platform. We continue to work with
&lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/partners/&quot;&gt;various resellers across the globe&lt;/a&gt; to
facilitate fast and painless procurement processes.&lt;/p&gt;

observed hostnames and domains&lt;/strong&gt; on urlscan Pro. This is a huge step forward
since it will allow customers to proactively look for new domains and hostnames
that might be of interest to them, even if these hostnames were not previously
scanned as a full-blown website through urlscan.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col col-md-12&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/hostnames-search.png&quot; title=&quot;urlscan Pro - Newly observed domains &amp;amp; hostnames&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;hostnames&lt;/em&gt; data source tracks newly
observed domains and hostnames sourced from multiple data sources including
Certificate Transparency, passive DNS monitoring, existing scan data,
zonefiles, etc. This data source lets customers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search for new domains and hostnames even if they were not scanned on urlscan.io.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search for new domains and hostnames using keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search for new domains based on infrastructure (such as A, MX, or NS records).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enumerate subdomains and hostnames for specific domains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enumerate hostnames / domains on a specific IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform reconnaissance and lightweight attack surface discovery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Export results via an API call or as a CSV file via the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create saved searches and email alerts. (Q1 / 2023)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;em&gt;certificates&lt;/em&gt; data source contains TLS certificates that have
been collected from various Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. With these
additions we are bringing in more of the discovery, alerting and analysis
workflow into urlscan Pro that customers previously had to combine using
auxiliary tools and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hostnames--domains-by-the-numbers&quot;&gt;Hostnames &amp;amp; Domains by the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently our &lt;em&gt;hostnames&lt;/em&gt; data sources contains &lt;strong&gt;1.5 billion unique
hostnames&lt;/strong&gt; across &lt;strong&gt;310 million unique registered domains&lt;/strong&gt;. More than half of
these domains already have a DNS resolution attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;certificates&lt;/em&gt; datasource contains &lt;strong&gt;more than 5 billion TLS certificates&lt;/strong&gt;
issued through Certificate Transparency logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these data source operate in &lt;em&gt;real time&lt;/em&gt;, with new records taking no
more than a minute before they appear in the search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making these data sources available for searching is just the first step. Over
the next year, these new additions will come together to form our fully
automated hands-off monitoring pipeline. This new pipeline will allow our
customers to set up keywords of interest within urlscan Pro and we will take care of the rest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will watch for and alert on newly observed hostnames matching these keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will try to resolve these hostnames via DNS until they have a DNS record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will scan for potential websites on these hosts and alert customers when a site goes live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will monitor the page content for changes, such as when a page goes from landing page to fully set up website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore these data sources will be more tightly integrated into the urlscan
Pro platform. We will add the same set of convenience features customers have
been used to, including &lt;em&gt;Saved Searches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E-Mail Subscriptions&lt;/em&gt; for new
hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pricing--availability&quot;&gt;Pricing &amp;amp; Availability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to these data sources and the upcoming alerting pipeline is free of
charge for customers on active subscriptions. For new customers and
subscription renewals customers can choose to add this functionality as a
separate subscription module.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Johannes Gilger</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="product" /><category term="announcement" /><summary type="html">Today we are officially launching our real-time feed and search index of newly observed hostnames and domains on urlscan Pro.

which visibility you should use for different purposes and how to review your
submission results on urlscan.io to detect and prevent inadvertent information
leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: Understand the different scan visibilities, review your own scans for non-public
information, review your automated submission workflows, enforce a maximum scan
visibility for your account and work with us to clean non-public data from urlscan.io!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scan-visibilities---introduction&quot;&gt;Scan Visibilities - Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you submit a URL to urlscan.io you can select the &lt;em&gt;visibility&lt;/em&gt; for
the scan result. The visibility controls which parties will be able to see the
URL you submitted and retrieve the scan results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public&lt;/strong&gt; means that the scan will be visible on the front page and in the
public search results and info pages. It will be visible to any visitor on
urlscan.io and search engines as well.&lt;br /&gt;
You should only use &lt;em&gt;Public&lt;/em&gt; scans if there are no concerns that the URLs you are
submitting contain any personal or proprietary information, either in the URL
itself or in the content of the page. This could be because you sourced these
URLs from another public data set, or because you discovered these URLs
yourself via crawling or keyword monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlisted&lt;/strong&gt; means that the scan will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be visible on the public page or
search results, but will be visible to customers of the urlscan Pro platform.
We only admit customers to urlscan Pro which are either vetted security
researchers or reputable corporations.&lt;br /&gt;
You should use &lt;em&gt;Unlisted&lt;/em&gt; scans if you think that there might be personal or
proprietary information within the websites, but you still want to document
the URLs to the audience of urlscan Pro so that they can take action
accordingly (automated takedowns, research, improving their products).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private&lt;/strong&gt; means that the scan will only be visible to yourself and not to
any of our customers or partners. If you are part of a team account and have
the team set as “Active”, then your private scans will also be visible to
other team members on that team account.&lt;br /&gt;
You should use &lt;em&gt;Private&lt;/em&gt; scans if you don’t want to share the scans you
perform with anyone else. The downside is that unique URLs that you might
submit will not be seen by anyone else, and potential malicious activity
might go unnoticed by the community and downstream security companies on the
urlscan Pro platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different reason for choosing specific visibility levels, and picking
the right one very much depends on source of the data you are analysing.
Customers might have different streams of URLs they want to analyses with
urlscan.io, and each stream might have its unique set of privacy
considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage user to use &lt;em&gt;Public&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Unlisted&lt;/em&gt; scans whenever possible since
it helps the whole security community keep track and understand threats rather
than siloing that information. But we understand that there are use-cases which
don’t allow anything but the &lt;em&gt;Private&lt;/em&gt; visibility level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reviewing-your-submission-results&quot;&gt;Reviewing your submission results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you use urlscan.io via the UI or the API you should frequently review
your submission results to ensure that you are not submitting inappropriate
URLs at any visibility level. To see a list of your own submissions first make
sure you are logged in to urlscan.io before executing the following searches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/search/#user%3Ame%20OR%20team%3Ame&quot;&gt;Search: &lt;strong&gt;All Scans&lt;/strong&gt; submitted by yourself and your teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/search/#(user%3Ame%20OR%20team%3Ame)%20AND%20task.visibility%3Apublic&quot;&gt;Search: &lt;strong&gt;Public Scans&lt;/strong&gt; submitted by yourself and your teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you understand &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; submissions are originating from: This might
be your employees or your automated tools such as SOAR platforms! You should
watch out for submissions for the following types of websites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hosted invoice pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DocuSign or other document signing requests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Drive / Dropbox links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email unsubscribe links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password reset or create links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web service, meeting and conference invite links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;URLs including PII (email addresses) or API keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-and-enforcing-a-default-visibility&quot;&gt;Setting and enforcing a default visibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;urlscan.io allows you to set a default visibility and even to enforce this as
the maximum visibility for all future scans. Both settings can be found in your &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; window on your user dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team account owners can change these settings team-wide and have them be
applied to every active team member. This is done on the &lt;em&gt;Settings&lt;/em&gt; page for
the team account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-are-doing-to-prevent-information-leaks&quot;&gt;What we are doing to prevent information leaks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are aware of the fact that non-public information is being scanned on
urlscan.io and are taking a number of steps to mitigate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have domain and URL pattern blocklists in place which prevent scanning of certain websites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have deletion rules in place which delete past and future scans for certain keywords and patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have recently made the &lt;em&gt;Scan Visibility&lt;/em&gt; setting in our user dashboard more visible and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have reached out to customers who we identified as submitting a significant amount of Public scans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We allow immediate takedown of single scans via the &lt;em&gt;Report&lt;/em&gt; button on each scan page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We work with customers and third parties to facilitate bulk-delete via our deletion rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are reviewing popular third-party integrations such as SOAR tools to ensure they respect the user intent with regards to visibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;em&gt;security researcher&lt;/em&gt; and have discovered a large number of scans
with non-public information we would ask that you reach out to

This
post will cover the highlights of new functionality in our urlscan Pro
platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;saved-searches--subscriptions&quot;&gt;Saved Searches &amp;amp; Subscriptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now save a search in urlscan Pro to be able to run it again later. On
top of that, you can also receive an email alert whenever there are new hits
for your saved searches. This allows you to create a number of hunt queries
which might only trigger occasionally and automatically receive notifications
when there are new hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;search-ui-improvements&quot;&gt;Search UI Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Search page in urlscan Pro was significantly improved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filters&lt;/em&gt; are a convenient way to add, remove and invert pre-defined common
search filters. We have a list of pre-defined filters that you can work with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the Search view, the new &lt;em&gt;Aggregations&lt;/em&gt; list shows you aggregate
information from your search results and allows you to further filter your
results by adding another facet to your filters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new quick filter dialog also contains completions for the &lt;em&gt;Brand Names&lt;/em&gt;
that we track in urlscan Pro.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever you have created an interesting search, you can now save it as a
&lt;em&gt;Saved Search&lt;/em&gt; directly from the search UI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can also use the new &lt;em&gt;CSV Export&lt;/em&gt; feature to retrieve the results as a
CSV file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;file-downloads&quot;&gt;File Downloads&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of scanning websites, urlscan.io will sometimes encounter file
downloads triggered by the website. If we are able to successfully download the
file, we will store it, hash it and make it available for downloading by our
customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To highlight this stream of data, we have created a separate &lt;em&gt;Downloads&lt;/em&gt; section
which contains the most recent file downloads and highlights the information we
store for each downloaded file. There is a dedicated Help Section on
Downloads which talks about API use and known limitations of this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;live-scanning&quot;&gt;Live Scanning&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following features were added to the the Live Scanning UI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Additional devices available for device emulation (iPhone 12, 13, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scanners can be selected via a new Select All button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scanner Details can be shown, such as the current exit IP, AS and VPN provider&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scan Results have been cleaned up to give a better overview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outgoing Links can now be scanned with a dedicated button&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Available Live Scan Quotas are shown within the scanning UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

urlscan Pro platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;visual-search&quot;&gt;Visual Search&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Search allows users to find historical scans with visually similar

&lt;p&gt;Live Scanning allows you to scan websites quickly, from different locations,
and with different browser options. Scan results are not automatically saved to
urlscan.io, but you can use Store Scan if you want to archive a particular scan
result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Scanning is a very versatile capability that can be used for a number of
common scenarios, including &lt;em&gt;Reconnaisance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Change Monitoring&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Remote

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/visualsearch.png&quot; alt=&quot;urlscan Pro - Visual Search&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-cases&quot;&gt;Use-Cases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Search allows users to find historical scans with visually similar
screenshots to a scan of interest. This type of feature is also called
&lt;em&gt;Content-Based Image Retrieval&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of querying for historical scans using
a structured textual query (such as search for a hostname or an IP address),
Visual Search uses an existing screenshot image as the query. Visual Search
works similar to popular &lt;em&gt;Reverse Image-Search&lt;/em&gt; engines like Google’s &lt;em&gt;Search
by Image&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;TinEye Reverse Image Search&lt;/em&gt;. Customers will be able to
leverage Visual Search feature to discover previously undetected cases of brand
impersonation or similar phishing pages based on the visual appearance of those
sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;availability&quot;&gt;Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Search is available today through the urlscan Pro portal. The feature is

urlscan.io and urlscan Pro platforms. This release will offer new functionality
to community and paid users. We have gathered customer feedback and
internal use-cases and came up with a list of additional attributes that would
be helpful to search on. This post outlines the highlights of new available
search attributes. All of the new searchable fields have been
integrated in a &lt;strong&gt;backward compatible&lt;/strong&gt; fashion, which means that any search
which previously worked on urlscan.io will continue to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The full list of searchable fields is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/search/&quot;&gt;Search API
Reference&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-searchable-attributes&quot;&gt;New searchable attributes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years we recognized various additional fields that we would
like to be able to search.  The &lt;strong&gt;title of the page&lt;/strong&gt; was an obvious addition,
and we have also gone ahead and added fields like the &lt;strong&gt;age of the TLS
certificate at the time the page was scanned&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;Cisco Umbrella rank for
the primary hostname of the page&lt;/strong&gt;. We hope that these new fields will allow
hunting for more interesting scans on urlscan.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wildcard-search&quot;&gt;Wildcard Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have changed the way that certain fields are indexed so that these fields
can more effectively be searched using regular expressions and wildcard
expressions. Especially for fields containing arbitrary information like URLs
or hostname it is often crucial to search using complex expressions, something
which was hard or outright impossible to do before. With the wildcard fields,
users can search for single characters in a field like the page url very
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-search&quot;&gt;Content Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers on our &lt;em&gt;Professional&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; plans can now find historical
scans by searching for strings in the &lt;strong&gt;text of the website&lt;/strong&gt;. We currently
index the first 20kB of visible text content per site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers can also search for structured information from the page, such as the
names and types of &lt;strong&gt;input fields&lt;/strong&gt;, the name of &lt;strong&gt;global JavaScript variables&lt;/strong&gt;,
and the &lt;strong&gt;detected technologies&lt;/strong&gt; employed by a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outgoing links from the website are now indexed by &lt;strong&gt;domain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;full URL&lt;/strong&gt;.
These fields can be searched to incoming links from other websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;verdicts--brand-search&quot;&gt;Verdicts &amp;amp; Brand Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have always allowed customers on our &lt;em&gt;Professional&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt; plans
to search for detections of malicious websites on our platform by means of our
brand detection system. Now we also incorporate &lt;strong&gt;community verdicts&lt;/strong&gt; into our
search index and combine them with our verdicts to form a global verdict and
score. These attributes are grouped under the &lt;em&gt;verdicts&lt;/em&gt; key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As next steps we will integrate pivoting via the additional attributes to
urlscan.io and our &lt;strong&gt;urlscan Pro&lt;/strong&gt; threat hunting platform. Changes to these
platforms will be announce on this blog and on the urlscan Pro platform.&lt;/p&gt;

users submit comments and verdicts about scans on urlscan.io. These verdicts
and comments will be publicly visible to other users and should be used to
document malicious, suspicious or legitimate websites. Users can classify scans
as &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;suspicious&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;malicious&lt;/em&gt;, or they can simply leave a
comment. If the scan is targeting or impersonating a specific brand then users
can select the brand from a predefined list.&lt;/p&gt;

community platform and our commercial products. There will be a separate post
with our 2022 product roadmap later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scanning-engine-v2&quot;&gt;Scanning Engine v2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of our biggest projects in 2021, we sat down and rewrote our scanning
engine from scratch. The result was the Scanning Engine v2 which can be used
for a multitude of purposes. The most important use-case is still the regular
scanning of URLs submitted through urlscan.io without any visible changes to
the user. Other use-cases include the &lt;strong&gt;Live Scanning&lt;/strong&gt; feature and different
internal scanning tasks that can now all be covered by the same codebase. These
changes have helped us deploy our engine much more quickly with just a few
lines of infrastructure definition. The new engine is also much more modular,
allowing users to define whether to store data to backend storages for example.
The scanner has a vast array of options now that can be changed at scan time
and a modular architecture that allows us to run it with different backend
modules and different connectivity options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new scanning engine allowed us to re-enable &lt;strong&gt;File Downloads&lt;/strong&gt; on
urlscan.io. Whenever a website triggers a file download, we will now capture
the downloaded file, hash it with SHA256 and store it ourselves. Users on the
&lt;em&gt;urlscan Pro&lt;/em&gt; platform will be able to download the files from our archive.
Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/search/#files.sha256%3A*&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;files.sha256 modifier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, users can
search for scans which triggered file downloads. We run a full web-browser
which means that we are even able to capture file-downloads using advanced
evasion tactics like &lt;strong&gt;HTML Smuggling&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the new scanning engine, we are able to run our scanner in more
locations. As a result we introduced &lt;strong&gt;Country Selection&lt;/strong&gt; for scans for all
users of urlscan.io. If a user does not select a country explicitly, we have
rules in place that try to determine the best scanner location for scanning a
URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;live-scanning&quot;&gt;Live Scanning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new, modular and highly configurable Scanning Engine v2 we were able
to quickly set up a large number of &lt;em&gt;geographically distributed scanners&lt;/em&gt;.
Geofencing and localisation are often issues when performing scans, so running
scanners from different places across the globe will hopefully allow more
websites to be scanned correctly. The name &lt;em&gt;Live Scanning&lt;/em&gt; highlights the fact
that the scans are faster and more lightweight because the scan results are not
automatically stored to urlscan.io. By default, Live Scanning results only live
in a temporary database for 60 minutes, unless the user explicitly requests a
Live Scan to be stored permanently on urlscan.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Scanning is one of the &lt;em&gt;building blocks&lt;/em&gt; we and our customers are able to
use for different purposes. It allows to quickly iterate through geolocations
and browser options to get a page to behave as expected. But it can also be
used as an appliance for specific tasks where a full scan on urlscan.io would
be unwarranted. Customers can use Live Scanning to quickly take a screenshot of
a website, or to grab a file from a remote geographical location for example.
With some additional logic, the Live Scanning API output can be used to monitor
websites for changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what Live Scanning allows you to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run scans from one or more of 25 possible countries in Europe, Asia, and North- and South-America&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capture full-page screenshots of the website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the page capture timeouts to better capture “slow” websites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable or disabling captured artifacts, like the screenshot, DOM snapshot, or file downloads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emulate common devices (iPhone, Android phones, etc), including the User Agent and device dimensions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supply a customer HTTP User Agent and additional custom HTTP headers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supply custom Accept-Language headers selection indicating language preferences&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the automatic Banner Bypass feature to accept and hide typical cookie-consent banners&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scan pages on the TOR network (.onion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/img/urlscanpro5.png&quot;&gt;Here is a screenshot of Live Scanning in action.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;urlscan-pro&quot;&gt;urlscan Pro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/pricing/urlscanpro/&quot;&gt;urlscan Pro&lt;/a&gt; received the most significant and visible
updates and new features in 2021. Major updates included our new Live Scanning
feature and &lt;strong&gt;Similarity Search UI and API&lt;/strong&gt;. The details of the Similarity
Search function are documented in the urlscan Pro portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added hundreds of additional &lt;strong&gt;Brands&lt;/strong&gt; to our brand monitoring system and
made the brands easier to explore in the urlscan Pro portal. For each brand we
show users helpful links to find potential additional brand-impersonation
attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added a &lt;strong&gt;Video Walkthrough&lt;/strong&gt; to the urlscan Pro frontpage to help new users
get started. The walkthrough covers all major aspects of urlscan and is
recommended viewing for new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get a glimpse at the new features check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/pricing/urlscanpro/&quot;&gt;dedicated page for urlscan
Pro&lt;/a&gt;. We are happy to report that urlscan Pro is the most
popular product, and the feedback we have received from customers has been very
positive. Customers also used our &lt;strong&gt;urlscan Pro / Enterprise Survey&lt;/strong&gt; to give
structured feedback which will be incorporated into the roadmap going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;products--pricing&quot;&gt;Products &amp;amp; Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We simplified our &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/pricing/&quot;&gt;Products lineup&lt;/a&gt; to be easier
to grasp for potential customers. We now have two pure API plans on the lower
end (&lt;em&gt;Starter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Advanced&lt;/em&gt;) which are aimed at customers who are looking to
automate URL analysis, e.g. via their SOAR tool. The two plans on the high end
(&lt;em&gt;Professional&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;) are meant for larger customers who have more
demanding automation needs and customers who are interested in using the
urlscan Pro platform, its data and APIs to hunt for interesting scans and
quickly pivot various attributes of existing scans to find the proverbial
needle in the haystack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added documentation pages for understanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/docs/search/&quot;&gt;every searchable field in our
Search Index&lt;/a&gt;, and the semantics behind it. We
also added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/docs/result/&quot;&gt;Result API Reference page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added support for &lt;strong&gt;Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)&lt;/strong&gt; based on TOTP to
urlscan.io for all users. Customers on team accounts can check that all team
members have 2FA enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For customers on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/pricing/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urlscan Professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/pricing/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urlscan
Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plans we implemented the option to login via
&lt;strong&gt;Federated Authentication&lt;/strong&gt;, often just called &lt;strong&gt;Single Sign-On (SSO)&lt;/strong&gt;. We
support SSO via the SAML 2.0 protocol which works with all major identity
providers such as Okta, Onelogin, PingIdentity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-platform&quot;&gt;Community Platform&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made hundreds of small but impactful changes to our urlscan.io community
platform. In addition to &lt;em&gt;Country Selection&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Two-Factor Authentication&lt;/em&gt;,
we rewrote the &lt;a href=&quot;https://urlscan.io/user/submit/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulk Submit Page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for logged-in users to
offer more scan options and to back off if API quotas are exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Result Page&lt;/strong&gt; for scans was continuously improved to better show the raw
data we capture and to highlight new data collected by our Scanning Engine v2,
such as the geographical location the scan was performed from, and builtin
pivots for links on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using a page hash and linking to the urlscan.io frontpage, everything in
the hash will be pre-filled into the submission box, so all you have to do is
to hit submit. This is how it works: &lt;tt&gt;https://urlscan.io/#https://google.com&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Johannes Gilger</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="changelog" /><category term="product" /><category term="api" /><category term="search" /><summary type="html">This post will be a recap of new features we launched in 2021, covering our community platform and our commercial products. There will be a separate post with our 2022 product roadmap later. Scanning Engine v2 As one of our biggest projects in 2021, we sat down and rewrote our scanning engine from scratch. The result was the Scanning Engine v2 which can be used for a multitude of purposes. The most important use-case is still the regular scanning of URLs submitted through urlscan.io without any visible changes to the user. Other use-cases include the Live Scanning feature and different internal scanning tasks that can now all be covered by the same codebase. These changes have helped us deploy our engine much more quickly with just a few lines of infrastructure definition. The new engine is also much more modular, allowing users to define whether to store data to backend storages for example. The scanner has a vast array of options now that can be changed at scan time and a modular architecture that allows us to run it with different backend modules and different connectivity options.</summary></entry></feed>
