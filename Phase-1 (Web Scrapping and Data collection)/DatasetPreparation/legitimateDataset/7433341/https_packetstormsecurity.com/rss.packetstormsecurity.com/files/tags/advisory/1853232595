<description>Debian Linux Security Advisory 5438-1 - A flaw was found in Asterisk, an Open Source Private Branch Exchange. A buffer overflow vulnerability affects users that use PJSIP DNS resolver. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2022-24793. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query record parse_query(), while the issue in CVE-2022-24793 is in parse_rr(). A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting nameserver_count to zero) or use an external resolver implementation instead.</description>

<description>Debian Linux Security Advisory 5437-1 - Gregor Kopf of Secfault Security GmbH discovered that HSQLDB, a Java SQL database engine, allowed the execution of spurious scripting commands in .script and .log files. Hsqldb supports a &quot;SCRIPT&quot; keyword which is normally used to record the commands input by the database admin to output such a script. In combination with LibreOffice, an attacker could craft an odb containing a &quot;database/script&quot; file which itself contained a SCRIPT command where the contents of the file could be written to a new file whose location was determined by the attacker.</description>

<description>It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle copy up operation in some conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges. It was discovered that the Broadcom FullMAC USB WiFi driver in the Linux kernel did not properly perform data buffer size validation in some situations. A physically proximate attacker could use this to craft a malicious USB device that when inserted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. It was discovered that a race condition existed in the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. Various other issues were also addressed.</description>
