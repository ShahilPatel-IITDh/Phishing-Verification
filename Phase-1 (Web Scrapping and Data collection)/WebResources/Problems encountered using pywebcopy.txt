When using pywebcopy, some of the HTML files may show a forbidden error:
1. the website owner has edited the file or folder permission settings so that the resources cannot be accessed
2. Another possible cause is that the website uses resources from other sites or APIs such as Bootstrap, FontAwesome, jQuery, and Cloudflare CDN, and these resources cannot be accessed


Limitations of Pywebcopy:
1.  If a website makes heavy use of JavaScript to operate, it is unlikely that pywebcopy will be able to make a true copy if it is unable to discover all of the website due to JavaScript being used to dynamically generate links.
2.  pywebcopy does not download the raw source code of a website, it can only download what the HTTP server returns. While it will do its best to create an offline copy of a website, advanced data-driven websites may not work as expected once they have been copied
3.  Therefore, checking the permissions of files and folders may not be relevant in all cases.
4.  Pywebcopy doesn't include a virtual DOM or nay form of JavaScript parsing.
